# Fast 8 / Late Game Scaling Strategy

## When to Play Fast 8
- Strong early game without excessive rolling
- Late game augments or flexible augments
- Lobby is slow (many players low HP by stage 4)
- Multiple good 4-cost or 5-cost carries available

## Execution Timeline
- **Stage 3-2**: Level to 6, strongest board without rolling
- **Stage 3-5**: Optional level to 7 if very healthy (80+ HP)
- **Stage 4-1**: Level to 7 (crucial timing)
- **Stage 4-5**: Level to 8
- **Stage 5-1**: Roll down at 8 to find 4-cost carries

## Economy Requirements
- 50+ gold at stage 3-5
- 70+ HP recommended
- Don't force if below 50 HP at stage 4-1

## Board Management
- Play strong 2-star 2-costs and 3-costs through stage 4
- Hold pairs but don't roll for them
- Flexible trait activation more important than specific units
- Slam items on temporary carries if needed

## Endgame
- At level 8, prioritize finding 2-star 4-costs
- Level 9 at stage 5-5 or 6-1 if healthy
- Don't greed for 5-costs if 4-cost comp is working

## Key Thresholds
- 70+ HP at stage 4-1: Safe to fast 8
- 50-69 HP at stage 4-1: Can fast 8 with good board
- Below 50 HP: Consider slower rolldown at 7
