# Reroll Compositions Strategy

## When to Play Reroll
- Strong early augments for the comp (trait-specific or reroll-specific)
- Hit early pairs of key units
- Weak lobby (many players contesting different comps)
- Stage 3 augment supports reroll playstyle

## Execution
1. **Stage 3-2**: Level to 6, roll to stabilize with 2-star units
2. **Stage 3-5 to 4-1**: Roll down to find 3-star carry
3. **Stage 4+**: If 3-star secured, push levels slowly. If not, may need to pivot

## Economy Management
- Acceptable to dip below 50 gold when rolling for 3-stars
- If hitting units well, can stay at level 6 longer
- Once 3-star secured, eco back to 50 before leveling

## Item Priority
- Stack damage items on main carry
- One defensive item often sufficient
- Don't over-commit items to units you'll sell

## Common Mistakes
- Rolling too early (before stage 3-2)
- Not committing hard enough (half-rolling)
- Staying level 6 too long after hitting
- Forcing reroll when uncontested 4-cost comp is stronger
