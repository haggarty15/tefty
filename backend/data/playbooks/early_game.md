# Early Game Strategy (Stages 1-3)

## Economy Management
- **Stage 1-2**: Natural level to 4, don't reroll unless you have pairs
- **Stage 2-1**: Aim for win streak or lose streak, avoid middle placements
- **Stage 2-5**: Should be at least 20 gold, consider leveling to 5 if healthy
- **Stage 3-2**: Decision point - either level to 6 for strong board or save for roll down at 3-5

## Win Streaking
- If you have strong early units (2-star 1-costs or good 2-costs), prioritize win streak
- Buy XP to maintain board strength
- Acceptable to be at 10-20 gold if maintaining streak
- Transition out before stage 4 when early units fall off

## Lose Streaking
- If weak start, commit to lose streak for carousel priority
- Maintain exactly 1-2 units on board to guarantee losses
- Stack economy to 50+ gold by stage 3
- Use carousel picks to pivot into strong comp

## Key Thresholds
- 50 gold: Maximum interest threshold
- Level 6 at stage 3-2: Standard for most comps
- Level 7 at stage 4-1: Fast 8 timing
- Level 8 at stage 4-5: Standard timing for most lobbies
